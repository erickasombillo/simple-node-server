        <p> My name is <strong> Jhoan Ericka Claudine Q. Sombillo</strong>.
        My family calls me <em>Jec</em>, my friends call me <em> Ericka</em> and some of my classmates and professors call me <em> Jhoan</em>.
        I was born on August 26, 1994 in Brgy. Batong Malake, Los Baños, Laguna.
        I'm a proud member of <strong><abbr title= "University of the Philippines Human Ecology Student Society">UP HESS</abbr></strong>.
        I headed the <em>Finance Committee</em> of the said organization.
        I love music while reading books  (specifically, electronic books).
        I'm a nature-loving person. I appreciate the beauty of our world and one of my dreams is to be able to travel different places.
