    <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em>
    <p>
     On the third spot of my top 3 movie picks is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY">Avatar</a>.
     As shown on its official trailer, the movie has a really fantastic visual and sound effects.
     Though the movie was not on Earth, it ,somehow, tells us that like, the nature in Pandora, Earth must be taken care of.
     Our place has a supernatural capability to control whatever we see that science still can not explain.
     In this movie, people with special ability were showed as strong persons.
     The movie showed us that we should not stop people with special ability to do what they want.
     Instead, we should motivate them and let them know that whatever their incapabilities are, it should not hinder them to be productive.
